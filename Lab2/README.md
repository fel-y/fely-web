A copy of the COMMENTED source code (.html, .js, .css) you made.
A README.md that gives me:
A title
A screenshot of a view of your map that you feel is interesting (how to put screenshots into a README (Links to an external site.)).
A working link to your map (doesn't have to be on GitHub, per se). 
Collaborations and reliance on other resources: Please document any so I know what you have been able to find and what you have added. What did you learn from a peer map critique, if you did one? What did you contribute to others? What coding resources (and individuals) did you draw upon in the process of making your map, and to what effect? (Commenting in the code itself at the places in question is helpful.) 

Reflective analysis: 
- designed for everyone to use in Toronto
- I focued on the central toronto area bc the mmunication cliniccs were clipped to central toronto
- it shoes the distribution of clinics relative to testing sites, there is underwhelming locations for immunication clinics relative to testing sites
- instead of toronto neighbour polygoon layer, have a population density by neighbourhood layer, to estimate the potential stress of clinics and testing fac

- A several-paragraph (2-3 paragraphs, revised with care; not essay-length) piece that gives the reader a discussion of the decisions that you made and the resulting insights that you think your interactive map is conveying. Some possibilities:
Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your map be improved? 
Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.

# Lab 1 - Web Cartography

This map shows the distribution of Food Banks and Health Service Locations in the province of British Columbia.

## Reflective analysis:

This map was designed and intended for use by the homeless/people in need, social work volunteers, and city planners. 

It is often assumed only the homeless or low-income individuals access food-banks, and many are ill or substance users. This map hopes to provide information for those in need and those who want to help and attempts to highlight the issue of geographical discrimination or generalization associated with the surrounding community for researchers and city planners. The distribution in this map shows sparse food banks surrounded by multiple mental health and substance use centres. This distribution pattern can further confirm and disseminate geographical stereotypes.

The base map was kept relatively simple with road and place labels for navigation use. Details increase as the user zooms in as not to overcrowd the map at lower levels of zoom. Another effort to de-clutter the map was to change the POI (Point of Interest) density by category based on what I thought was appropriate. I increased the density of essential services and decreasing those of entertainment and other unrelated categories.
At the same zoom level and symbol size, the purple circles looked larger than the orange circles. So the orange circles were made larger to balance the difference in size perception. The colours orange and purple create visual contrast between the categories and against the base-map. 
Popups are activated if the user clicks on a circle, which provides detailed information on the address, website, phone number, and description for the facilities, if available in the GeoJSON.

Future improvements for this map include completing the original GeoJSON file since some facilities have incomplete fields. The map can become more useful with more integration of amenities for people in need, such as temporary housing, soup kitchens, legal support, thrift stores and more. A quick search found that compiled datasets are unavailable or not open-source for these amenities. 

## Critque on the Map's first draft (Changes have been made and relfected in analysis) :
```
undefined
Ashcroft , BC , V0K 1A0
website: undefined
Phone: undefined
```
* I like how it says "website: undefined". What is undefined in the first line?
* the black is nice but its a bit stark
* the red (now orange) circles are bigger which makes me think they are more important than the black (now purple) ones
* Food and mental health is actually super accessible, but other things like dental, law, are not.
* what is the purpose of this map? 
  * It is hard to draw the connection between the two variables.
  * consider the experience of the person viewing this - is it for someone who is experiencing homelessness or for research purposes and community volunteers looking to help people expereincing homelessness?
